## 📖 Overview

**Kaki-utsushi** (Japanese for "transcribing" or "copying by hand") is a precision tool designed for designers and developers. It allows you to "lift" the typographic identity of any webpage—capturing font families, weights, sizes, and spacing—and apply them instantly to other elements or save them for inspiration.

No more inspecting elements to find the perfect font. Just **Collect** and **Apply**.

## ✨ Features

- **🎯 Precision Capture**: Instantly extract font-family, weight, size, line-height, and color.
- **📄 Auto-Collect**: Automatically detects the main article content on a page and harvests its typographic DNA.
- **Library Management**: Keep a curated list of your favorite typography styles in a sleek, Japandi-inspired popup interface.
- **⚡ Quick Apply**: Inject collected styles into any page to preview how your content looks with premium typography.
- **🛠 Edit Mode**: Tweak captured properties before applying them to ensure a perfect fit.

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** (top right).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the project folder.

## 🛠 Usage

1. **Collect**: Click the **Collect** button in the popup to automatically grab the article styles, or select text on a page to capture specific styles.
2. **Preview**: View your collection in the "Collected" tab.
3. **Apply**: Navigate to the "Applied" tab or use the context menu to apply a saved style to the current page.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Inspired by the concept of *Utsushi* (写し), the project focuses on the respectful study and reproduction of beautiful design patterns. The UI is built to be minimalist, focused, and out of your way.
